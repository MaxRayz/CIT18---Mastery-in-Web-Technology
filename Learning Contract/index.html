            <h2>Expectations:</h2>
            <p>
                I expect to learn and have a better understanding on topics that are to be taught in this course
                subject. I do hope that the instructor’s teaching style adapts to the class’s learning style. I expect
                to have a fun and engaging time learning, while also seeing that everyone will be treated fairly. I also
                expect that the things I am taught in this subject will help me in my future career path.

            <h2>Contributions:</h2>
            <p>
                I will do my part and ensure that I have a perfect attendance, so long as I can help it. I will submit
                all activities given to me on time, while doing trying to actively participate in recitations and any
                other activities that require it. I will not cause problems for my instructors and classmates by being a
                nuisance. I will do my best to get high scores on activities by listening to the lectures and studying
                what I do not fully understand.

            <h2>Motivations:</h2>
            <p>
                Knowing how much my tuition costs is big enough of a motivation. The support of my family keeps me
                going. My curiosity helps keep me engaged, and knowing I need to pass this subject if I want to be one
                step closer to graduating does help a lot in trying to achieve my goals. I know that this subject will
                further broaden my understanding on technology, and that keeps me motivated.

        <section>
            <h2>Hindrances:</h2>
            <p>
                If there are online activities and lessons that are to be done at home, my internet connection may
                sometimes cause me problems. Frequent blackouts/power interruptions may be a hindrance for online
                lessons and activities to be done at home. My mental health is not always the best, and that can can
                cost me losing what is being taught.
